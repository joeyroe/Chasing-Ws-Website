                My name is Joey, and I'm the app designer of 'Chasing Ws' and 'Looking for Ws'. Not to toot my own horn, but I 
                also made this website and everything on it (Chasing Ws and Finding Ws). I 
                myself value my privacy, and I also very much value the privacy of anybody that uses 'Chasing Ws' and 'Looking For Ws', 
                I do not collect any personal data. Nope, none, zero, no persoanl data is collected. I designed 
                'Chasing Ws' and 'Looking For Ws' to be offline games that can be enjoyed in spare time, and not collect personal data. 
                The only data that is saved to your device in 'Chasing Ws' is the high-score, and there isn't even a score in 'Looking For Ws', there are only mazes. 
                This website also doesn't collect any data, only saves your high-score to the browser. If you send me an email or contact me via 
                social media, I may keep a copy of that.

                I did use a game engine called 'Flame' to help build my apps 'Chasing Ws' and 'Looking For Ws'. If you'd like to know more about it
                here's the link:
