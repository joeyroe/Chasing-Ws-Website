                I, Joey, am the app designer of Chasing Ws, I am also the designer of this very website. I 
                myself value my privacy, and I also very much value the privacy of anybody that uses Chasing Ws the 
                app and or this website. I can tell you that as the designer/creator, I designed 
                Chasing Ws the app and this website to not collect any of your personal data. 
                The only data that is saved in this game is your high-score. In the app your high-score is saved to your 
                device, and on this website your high-score is saved to the browser. If you send me an email or contact me via 
                social media, I may keep a copy of that.

                I did use a game engine called 'Flame' to build Chasing Ws the app. If you'd like to know more about it
